When a ship executes a maneuver, the player uses a template to change the ship’s position. Then, the ship may be affected by the maneuver’s difficulty.
To move the ship, the player follows these steps:
<ol>
<li>Take the template that matches the maneuver from the supply.</li>
<li>Set the template between the ship’s front guides so that it is flush against the base.</li>
<li>Pick up and place the ship at the opposite end of the template, sliding the rear guides of the ship into the template.</li>
<li>Return the template to the supply.</li>
</ol>
After moving the ship, the player checks the difficulty (color) of the maneuver. If the maneuver is red, the ship gains one stress token. If the maneuver is blue, the ship removes one stress token.

A ship is **stressed** while it has one or more stress tokens. A stressed ship cannot set or execute red maneuvers, and it cannot perform actions.

After a ship gains a token (such as a stress token), it is placed next to the ship. As the ship moves, the tokens move with it.
