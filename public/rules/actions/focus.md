Focus represents the pilot clearing their mind of distractions, allowing them to act in harmony with the galaxy and improve their combat ability.

When a ship performs a <i class="xwing-miniatures-font xwing-miniatures-font-focus"></i> action, it gains a focus token, which is placed next to that ship. While attacking, a ship can spend a focus token during the Attack Dice step to change all of its <i class="xwing-miniatures-font xwing-miniatures-font-focus"></i> results
to <i class="xwing-miniatures-font xwing-miniatures-font-hit"></i> results. While defending, a ship can spend a focus token during the Defense Dice step to change
all of its <i class="xwing-miniatures-font xwing-miniatures-font-focus"></i> results to <i class="xwing-miniatures-font xwing-miniatures-font-evade"></i>
 results.

All unspent focus tokens are removed during the End Phase
