Lock represents the ability of a ship’s computer to obtain a target lock, tracking the target’s movement and assisting with attacks against it. When a ship performs a <i class="xwing-miniatures-font xwing-miniatures-font-lock"></i> action, it follows these steps:
<ol>
<li>Measure range from the locking ship to any number of ships.</li>
<li>Choose a ship at range 0–3.</li>
<li>Assign a **lock** token to that ship with the lock’s number matching the ID token of the locking ship.</li>
</ol>
A ship is #locked while it has at least one lock token assigned to it. While a ship attacks a ship it has locked, during the Attack Dice step, it can spend its lock to reroll one or more of its attack dice. A ship can only maintain one lock at a time; if it locks again, it must remove the previous lock.
