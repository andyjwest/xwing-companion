Evade represents the pilot flying erratically or unpredictably to make it harder for enemy ships to hit them.

When a ship performs an <i class="xwing-miniatures-font xwing-miniatures-font-evade"></i> action, it gains an evade token, which is placed next to that ship. While defending, a ship can spend an evade token during the Defense Dice step to change one of its blank or <i class="xwing-miniatures-font xwing-miniatures-font-focus"></i> results to an <i class="xwing-miniatures-font xwing-miniatures-font-evade"></i> result.

Just like focus tokens, all unspent evade tokens are removed during the End Phase.
