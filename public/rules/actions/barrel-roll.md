Barrel rolling allows a pilot to move their ship laterally and adjust their position. When a ship performs a <i class="xwing-miniatures-font xwing-miniatures-font-barrelroll"></i> action, it follows these steps:
<ol>
<li>Take the [1 <i class="xwing-miniatures-font xwing-miniatures-font-straight"></i>] template.</li>
<li>Place the short edge of the template flush against the left or right side of the shipâ€™s base. The template must be placed with the middle line of the template aligned with the hashmark on the side of the base.</li>
<li>Lift the ship off the play surface, then place the ship so that the hashmark on the other side of the base is aligned to the front, middle, or back of the other short end of the template.</li>
</ol>

A ship cannot barrel roll if it would overlap another ship or if it would move through or overlap an obstacle.
